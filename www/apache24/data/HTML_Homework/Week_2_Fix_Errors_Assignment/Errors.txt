The first error is on line 11, the header text is surrounded by '<' and '>' this makes the text nonvisible by the viewer of the page.
The next error is from lines 13-15, the ending tag had a '\' instead of a '/'
Also for the entire document, a good practice is to number paragraphs just like you would number headers
The next error is on line 17 where the author tries to define the color of tex, this should be done as follows: <em><font-color="red">Your Text Here</font></em>
The next error is on line 21 where there is a useless <hr> tag
Line 23 should be as follows: <div align=center>
Line 24 should have a closing italics tag instead of two italics declaration tags
Line 27, not really a page breaking error but the header tag should not be capitolized
Line 29, there is a un-needed paragraph tag
Line 30 has an incorrect closing tag, i.e. the line should end in </li> instead of <li>
Line 32 has a </ol> tag instead of a </li> tag ending 
Line 34 should have a </ul> tag
Missing a closing <body> tag for the main body of the page
Not an error but for cleaner code you can delete line 36 as it contains nothing
Line 14 and 15 have the <em> tag beginning and ending before the main paragraph tag

Some of my descriptions of errors are hard to describe so I am attaching a fixed version of the web page to this submission.
