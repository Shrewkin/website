    <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">This is my pet cat Sonya</h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">
    <ul>
        <li>Since she is adopted from the streets <em>she is breedless</em></li>
        <li>She is a very friendly cat who loves to be pet</li>
        <li>She has grey, brown, and white fur</li>
        <li>She also loves to sleep on my keyboard when I work</li>
    </ul>
    <p1>Other than the points listed above, she is a very kind cat, but since we adopted her recently, she hasn't been in good relations with 
        our other cat <em><b>Kitya</b></em> but have hopes that over time tensions will lower.

    <h2>Other Pets</h2>
    <p2>In terms of other pets we used to have a dog named <em> <b>Sharik</b></em> but unfortunately he passed away in mid 2019. We also have another cat
    named <em><b>Kitya</b></em> who loves to hide and keep to herself.<br>We also have a parrot at home, but I am not too fond of him since he doesnt really like me
    so I stend to stay away from him.</p2>
